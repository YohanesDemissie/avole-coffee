      <p class="about-content">
        Avole Coffee is a company that produces and sells authentic Ethiopian Coffee and curates a culture of hospitality
        and
        cooperation in local communities at each retail location. Our start-up social enterprise has been in operation for
        3
        years. Since its inception, it has been entirely funded through the support and sweat equity of our local
        community in
        Seattle. Known for our outstanding coffee and culture, we understand that our connection to the people we serve is
        what
        makes us great. We pride ourselves in roasting premium coffee in house and creating a thriving community space of
        empowerment.

      <p class="about-content">
        Avole Coffee is not just a coffee company. Each Avole location is a living laboratory; a community centered
        open-innovation ecosystem where people co-create, explore, experiment and evaluate innovative concepts, projects
        and
        initiatives in order to collectively empower ourselves and generate transformative change. Much like the Ethiopian
        kaffa
        (coffee) we serve we are a unifying force that brings people together around our common humanity. Avole means
        ‘first
        cup’ in Amharic referring to the first cup poured from the jebena (traditional coffee pot) during the Ethiopian
        coffee
        ceremony. It is common for one to begin to share the story of his or her day while enjoying this cup. Cafe Avole
        is a
        venue for diverse communities to come together to share their stories and renew genuine connections across social
        divides.

      <p class="about-content">
        The ultimate vision of Avole Coffee is to develop an equitable coffee business ecosystem that empowers the farmers
        who
        grow our coffee and the people who consume it to gain more from each cup. We aim to develop a large market for
        authentic
        Ethiopian heirloom coffee in the US and to establish direct trade relationships with farmers in Africa that
        empower them
        to gain more from the coffee they produce. Avole Coffee is all about equity. We give more to our farmers, our
        customers
        and our employees. We have diligently cultivated meaningful relationships with farmers and consumers by leveraging
        both
        our platform in the American coffee capital, Seattle and in the African coffee capital, Ethiopia. We intend to
        empower
        farmers by both offering a better price and sharing the resources and systems that have empowered us in the US.
